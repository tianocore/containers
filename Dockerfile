# This file contains the definitions for images to be used for different
# jobs in the EDK2 CI pipeline. The set of tools and dependencies is split into
# multiple images to reduce the overall download size by providing images 
# tailored to the task of the CI job. Currently there are two images: "build"
# and "test".
# The images are indented to run on x86_64.


# Build Image
# This image is intended for jobs that compile the source code and as a general
# purpose image. It contains the toolchains for all supported architectures, and
# all build dependencies.
